Hello, I am Tingchen Fu (‰ªòÂª∑Áêõ in Chinese), a 3rd-year master student in Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China as an NLP researcher and a fanatic believer on AGI, advised by [Xueliang Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h-87C9cAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Rui Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=eLw6g-UAAAAJ).  **I am actively seeking a PhD position in NLP starting at Fall 2025. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact.**

I am genelly interested in machine learning, language technology, and their intersection, with a special emphasis on understanding and unleashing the full potential of Large Language Models. Specifically, I am currently interested in the following topics:
- LLM alignment.
- Safety and robustness of LLM and VLM system.
- LLM for reasoning.
