<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello, I am Tingchen Fu (付廷琛 in Chinese), a 2nd-year master student in Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China as an NLP researcher and a fanatic believer on AGI, advised by [Xueliang Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h-87C9cAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Rui Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=eLw6g-UAAAAJ). I occasionally have short excursions to the industry world. Currently I am an intern at Tencent AI Lab, mentored by Dr. [Lemao Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lCvNOg4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and work in close colleboration with Dr. [Deng Cai](https://jcyk.github.io/).  **I am actively seeking a PhD position in NLP starting at Fall 2025. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact.**

I am genelly interested in machine learning, language technology, and their intersection, with a special emphasis on understanding and unleashing the full potential of Large Language Models. Specifically, I am currently interested in the following topics:
- the alignment of large langauge model.
- Data/Compute efficient language model training.
- Understanding and mitigating the limitations of LLM like social bias, privacy leakage, and hallucination.
