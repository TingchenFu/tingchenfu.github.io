Hello, I am Tingchen Fu (‰ªòÂª∑Áêõ in Chinese). After spending lovely four years in Renmin University of China as an CS undergraduate, I am now starting a new journey in Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China as an NLP researcher and a fanatic believer on AGI,  advised by [Xueliang Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h-87C9cAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Rui Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=eLw6g-UAAAAJ). I occasionally have short excursions to the industry world and I am currently an intern at Tencent AI Lab, mentored by Dr. [Lemao Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lCvNOg4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

I have broad research interest around intelligent dialogue system, data-driven analysis of deep learning models, and the development of large language model. Particularly, I am fancinated by the capacity and potential of language models and dedicated to unveil how to inject and extract knowledge from language models. Enjoying the exploration to the cutting edge of NLP and AGI, I am happy to share my trials and findings at top international AI Conferences. You can find my publications at [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bv_8Q_kAAAAJ&hl=en).
